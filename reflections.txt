Reflections:

1. How long did you spend working on this project?
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
4. Where do you still have room to grow?


1.
I spend approximately 6 hours for this project. Most of the time i was trying to increase the functionality without throwing errors in the app.rb file

2.
The most rewarding on this challenge was the overall process of developing a system which can be used as an inventory system.
There is still stuff to add to make it fully usable, but i liked to develop a process and also implementing it all by my own

3.
One of the feature implemented is a wallet, which will decrease of increase if there is a transaction by a customer or if the inventory increases by purchases from a vendor
Furthermore there are now additional options for the transaction. like buy, sell, quantity and a additional discount.
The transaction class also includes now a timestamp and a username which will be automatically added (as a fraud prevention)
In addition, the transaction class can now be saved in a file, like a report

4.
I still have room to grow in inheritance methods. I really would like to have those 3 classes inherited by a common inventory class.
Methods like self.all are used for products, transaction and customer have the same function. I tried to find a solution for that online,
but i wasn't able to find any decent information on how to inherit Class functions with self and/or a class variable.
